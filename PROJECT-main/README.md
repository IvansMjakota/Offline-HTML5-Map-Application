*Final Code*
XML_Draw: 
Contains all the main code for the final submission

Notes:
In order to test the code out in Visual Studio Code download the Live Server (Ritwick Dey) extension, after the download one can right click on the HTML file XML_Dot.html and click the top option *Open with Live Server* which will produce a web page with all the code in the XML_Draw section

*Interim Code*

HTML drawing:
MAJORITY OF THE CODE DIRECTLY TAKEN FROM THE VIDEO https://youtu.be/mRDo-QXVUv8?si=CR9FKF_tI1zAEYby AND USED PURELY AS INSPIRATION FOR HTML SHAPE CODE AS WELL AS TO TEST OUT DIFFERENT FEATURES OF THE CANVAS

HelloWorld:
After right clicking the html file and opening it using a live server you can see the service workers active if you press f12 on the keyboard and go to console to see the displayed messages regarding the current status of service workers. If any information is written into the html file and updated while the server is live it will update accordingly and get cached.

HTML Shapes:
Open the html file in a live server, then you can choose the width, colour or shape to draw in the middle of the screen and after pressing draw the canvas will draw the shape for you

To-Do list:
Open in a live server, any text can be added as an item after which it's stored on the web, if you press clear the web storage get's cleared and so does the list

XML Geo-Data rendering:
When opening in a live server an XML file will be displayed, this is due to the AJAX query being sent to the Overpass API that returns the result of the query which is the displayed on the screen. The values are hard coded.
